## Overview
Data science projects have a number of important processes, including data collection, data
preparation (including data wrangling), data visualization, and prediction or forecasting, where
the project's results can be seen. This course, CIS601, covered all of these processes in detail.
Our goal in this research is to delve deeper into these steps and practice them with a wellknown dataset.
Dataset is one of the key aspect of the data science project, therefore, finding a dataset that can
help you understanding the data science processes is desired unless you are working in a
company and this company has its own dataset and allowed you to work with it, you can explore
a lot of datasets found in the following links:

## Deliverables:
1. Code (‘.ipnyp’ files):
1.1. Dataset Preparation (There may be data anomalies that you need to account for
before moving on to other activities. Describe how you cleaned the data. Take
the information you require and reformat it.) 
1.2. Make five useful graphs that show different features of the data. Write a
paragraph in your report for each plot describing the interesting qualities that
your visualization shows. These must include the following:
1.2.1. a minimum of one line chart
1.2.2. a minimum of one scatter plot
1.2.3. at least one bar chart or histogram
1.3. Architecture of the model(s). 
1.4. Training (make sure to save your training output and plot the loss and accuracy
curves)
1.5. Testing. 
2. Documentation (‘,pdf’ file): 
2.1. Abstract
2.2. Introduction stating the problem and some context about the proposed solution.
2.3. Proposed Solution:
2.3.1. Architecture Description with Visualization Figures.
2.3.2. Training Description.
2.4. Results and Evaluation:
2.4.1. Evaluation Metrics Summary
2.4.2. Summary of Results.
2.4.3. Conclusion
